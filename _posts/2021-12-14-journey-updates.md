It's been a while since I created a post so I figured I would stop by and say what's up. I have looked at a bunch of different material to help me figure out what it takes to successfully author malware and also evade detection. Some of my personal projects have been tabled though due to competing life priorities and struggles, but we get back on the wagon once we realize that we were thrown off.

Some of my more tangible goals are to reset up my home lab network. That means fresh installs of an OS on my tower and acquiring VMs for the components that can be virtualized.

I am also going to be finishing up some training endeavors. Certifications achieved or not, I think the main benefits to this effort is actual practice doing the stuff I said I want to do.

I am also going to be finishing up some training endeavors. Certifications achieved or not, I think the main benefits to this effort is actual practice doing the stuff I said I want to do. Some of the courses I am looking at finishing up would be the [sektor7][s7] coursework, [zero2automated][z2a] coursework, and then finally the [osep][osep]. In addition to the malware courses, I'm also going to be brushing up on some development work as well. Plan to finally knock out this lingering python course that I had gotten on sale at udemy, and then round it off with writing code for the windows platform first, even though I have a mac.

All in all, I want this next few months to be focused and intentional. I want to have a hyperbolic-time-chamber sort of effect on my skills as a red teamer.
