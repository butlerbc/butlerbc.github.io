I am trying to figure out this whole Jekyll thing. This is my first serious attempt in a long time and the first blog that I have started in a while. Hopefully this one sticks.
We will see what happens though. I do kinda like the simplicity of just typing files, but at the same time I think it is much easier to just fill out information in a gui. Especially when it means that I will need to possibly use some CSS to change the look and feel.

{% highlight python %}
print("Hello World!")
{% endhighlight %}
