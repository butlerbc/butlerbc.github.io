I recently copped an M1 MacBook Pro 13". I thought I was about to be sweet and able to do all of my research with this new and exciting hardware. Boy was I wrong... I was dropped into a world where native running software would be hard to find. The ARM architecture made it so that I couldn't run the software that I had been looking forward to using. No virtualization of x86 meant i wasnt going to be running any of the labs I expected. It has been really rough, but last night I came across some blog posts that have outlined a way forward. UTM!

As I spend some more time running UTM, I'll keep you guys updated on my experience. For those who are unaware, [UTM][utm] is an emulation and virtualization software built for iOS and Mac.
