***What am I to do now?** Thats the million dollar question.* 

I don't have all the answers ( go figure ) ... but what I do know is I am ready for another challenge. It's not that I have mastered everything I "know" already. I am far from an expert in any of the domains in which I have knowledge. But my ADHD makes it so that I get extremely disinterested and bored in the things that I have learned already. Plus, I tend to do things in waves. I'd say that it is time to revist my programming days and dive deep into malware development. I am going through Sektor7 Mal Dev Essentials course and after that, Intermediate. I'll be reading articles on implants in the wild and trying to reverse engineer live samples to get a feel for obfuscation techniques. 

I'll be documenting the journey here and if you have any suggestions on where to go for resources, drop me a line!
